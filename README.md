Pokédex

For this project I found a json containing a list of the original 151 Pokémon. The json contains the name, a url to the image and some basic details.

Instead of loading each image into the asset catalog I decided to just load the images dynamically.

The rest of the project was very similar to the food menu homework.

There was a little extra data about what Pokémon evolve into what so I added that as an additional navigation link.
